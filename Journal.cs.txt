Journal.cs
 
What it does:
Stores all journal entries in a list.
Contains methods to add entries, display them, save to a file, and load from a file.
 
Key points / fixes:
 
The list of entries (_entries) must be initialized; otherwise, trying to add something will crash the program.
All methods are empty stubs, which is correct for Week 2.
Using a constructor to initialize the list ensures the program builds and runs safely.

Entry.cs
 
What it does:
 
Represents a single journal entry.
Holds the date, the prompt used, and the text of the entry.
Can display itself (date, prompt, and text).
 
Key points / fixes:
 
Variable naming should match the design (e.g., _promptText) for consistency.
The Display method is correct and follows object-oriented principles: each entry handles its own display.
No other changes needed because this class is simple and matches the mentor’s design.

PromptGenerator.cs
 
What it does:
 
Stores a list of prompts that can be used for journal entries.
Provides a method to return a random prompt.
 
Key points / fixes:
 
The list of prompts (_prompt) must be initialized; otherwise, adding prompts will crash.
The random prompt method is correct and doesn’t need changes.
Initialization is the only required fix to make the class safe to use.

Program.cs
 
What it does:
 
Handles user interaction.
Shows a menu with options to write an entry, display entries, load/save, and exit.
Calls other classes to do the work.
 
Key points / fixes:
 
The PromptGenerator must be instantiated correctly before use.
userInput must be declared before the loop to avoid compile errors.
Console.ReadLine() must be spelled correctly (case-sensitive).
Minor cleanup like removing incorrect Console.Write() ensures the program builds without errors.
The loop structure and menu display are correct for a stub program.
